# hello-world
Hello my name is Lucas, 
I come from the area of ​​physical education, due to the covid-19, I was submitted to adapt to the world in which we are living, since everything is started, 
I have been studying different areas in my life, finance, marketing, entrepreneurship , biology, chemistry, philosophy, among other things that I tried to learn 
on my own during the quarantine, an education that I did not have access to in the teaching offered in Brazil. "When the only instrument you have is a hammer, 
every problem that comes up you treat like a nail." (Mark Twain). I thank the universe for the opportunity to start my python journey.
